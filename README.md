# Optimized-Models
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Fritcha/Optimized-Models)](https://github.com/Fritcha/Optimized-Models/releases/latest) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Fritcha/Optimized-Models)](https://github.com/Fritcha/Optimized-Models/blob/master/LICENSE)

*I know that the releases do not include versions 0.7.1 and 0.7.2 but that will likely not change as they do not update any files that are on the github(also bacause i'm lazy).*
